# Unit 6 case study repository


Unit 6 case study involves GDP and income group datasets from the worldbank.
The purpose of this study is to learn how to download files from the web, clean them, recognize NA's and decide whether to include or exclude them (excluded in this study). Learn how to merge two tables, filter, arrange, plot, and produce output in Rmarkdown, and publish to Github.  At this point I'm feeling more like it is doable, just takes way too long to figure out the R syntax for me at my current skill level.
